# Skill 1: using the print() function
print("Hello, World!")

# Syntax for printing a string of text
print("I love Python!")

# Syntax for printing numeric values
print(360)
print(32*45)

# Syntax for printing the value of a variable
value = 8*6
print(value)


# Skill 2: Using arithmetic operators, with a focus on exponents
# Multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction
print(3*8/2+5-1)
 
# Exponents
print(4**6) # Syntax means 4 to the power of 6
print(4**2) # To square a number
print(4**3) # To cube a number
print(4**0.5) # To find the square root of a number

# To calculate how many different possible combinations can be formed using a set of "x" characters with each character in "x"
# having "y" number of possible values, you will need to use an exponent for the calculation:
x = 4
y = 26
print(y**x)
